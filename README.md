- By: Anastasia, Jiyoo, Jolie, Kole, Krystana, Sujay
### Overview
For UTRAHacks, our team made a PID line tracing robot that can traverse an obstacle course and pick up and carry small boxes along the path. We finished the hardware and worked on most of the software, which can be further improved by testing and iteration.

**Material constraints:** 
1 medium sized breadboard
4 9V batteries 
2 9V battery holders 
1 Ultrasonic Sensor 
1 Arduino Uno (USB-C)
1 Arduino wire 
4 Wheels
2 DC motors 
2 DC motor holders 
2 DC motor drives
1 Screwdriver
2 Servo Motor
1 Color sensor
2 IR Sensors 
20 M-M, M-F, F-F Wires (20 of each type) 
1 Laser Cut Base 
1 Claw and arm
